# AI in Bioinformatics
This project explores how machine learning, deep neural network, and natural language processing techniques can be applied to Boinformatics in the areas of gene/protein expression, sequence analysis, strucural bioinformatics, network and system biology[1].

The main steps are as follows:
- First, data are collected and converted to the format if necessary that can be used by the programs, for example, .arff to .csv file.
- Next, data are pre-processed to drop nan values, remove columns that are not relevant, convert categories into numeric values.
- After that, split the data into training data and testing data if they are not seperated yet. Then scale the values to be within comparable range.
- Reduce the number of features if it is huge.
- Perform hyperparameters to pick the best hyperparameters.
- Train the model by using the best parameters.
- Do prediction and evaluate the performance.
